The last saved sequence value is stored in in-out parameter, v_max_value.\n\nIf you create a relational target, the Mapping task inserts data into the target table the first time it runs. Subsequent runs can load data using update or upsert operations. If you create a flat file target, the Mapping task re-creates the target file each time it runs.",
